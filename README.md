## Git Configuration

This repository includes a brief overview of Git configuration files and how they adjust its behavior.

### Configuration Files:

1. **/etc/gitconfig**  
   - Affects all users and repositories on the system.
   - Command: `git config --system`.

2. **~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config**  
   - User-specific configuration.
   - Command: `git config --global`.

3. **.git/config (in the repository)**  
   - Applies only to the current repository.

Each file contains settings that Git uses to determine its behavior. You can read or modify these files depending on the level where you want the changes to apply.

**Note:** This repository will help you learn and manage Git configuration properly.
